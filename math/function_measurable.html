<h1>Measurable Function</h1>
<hr/>
<br/><br/>

<b>INTRO. </b> Measurable functions in measure theory are analogous to continuous functions 
in topology. A continuous function pulls back open sets to open sets, while a 
measurable function pulls back measurable sets to measurable sets.
<br/><br/>
<b>INTRO. </b> The measurability of a function depends only on the \(\sigma\)-algebra; 
it is not necessary that any measures are defined. So, very often, measurable functions are defined 
between measurable space (not measure space). 
<br/><br/>
<b>INTRO. </b> In order to show that a function is measurable, it is sufficient to check the 
measurability of the inverse images of sets that generate the \(\sigma\)-algebra on the target space.
